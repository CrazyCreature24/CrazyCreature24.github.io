				<h3 id="section1">Cable Justice</h3>
				<p>
					This is the first major project prototype that I completed in Unreal Engine 5. It was created by a group of six of us for our second-year project in the Game Development program at Algonquin College. The game draws inspiration from 'Fez.' Utilizing perspective as your greatest ally, solve each of the four rooms by collecting all three pieces of evidence needed to open the door to the next room. Pick up and throw balls to hit switches that control doors blocking your path to various pieces of evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					I served as the project manager for this endeavor, which entailed numerous responsibilities. These responsibilities included taking meeting minutes every week, delegating tasks to team members, and crafting the Game Design Document <a href="files/Game_Design_Document_V0.6.docx" download="Cable Justice GDD">Download GDD</a>. Additionally, I served as the intermediary between the professor and the rest of the team. This role taught me valuable lessons, such as how to collaborate with diverse individuals and cultivate effective planning habits.
				</p>
				<p>
					Approaching this project, I was initially unaware of the time certain tasks would require. This experience taught me the importance of delegating tasks appropriately and identifying team members' strengths. It broadened my understanding of people and equipped me with skills to navigate situations where work might not align with expectations, all while maintaining a professional demeanor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, we encountered the challenge of overscoping the project. This necessitated making tough decisions regarding what to retain and what to cut in order to meet our deadlines.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also took on the role of one of the programmers on the team. My responsibilities included designing the player's mechanics, which encompassed movement, pickup, dropping, throwing, implementing a distance tracker above the player, and creating post-processing materials. These materials enabled the player and other objects to remain visible through walls, enhancing visibility within the maze-like environment. Furthermore, I developed comprehensive Module Design Documents for all the mechanics I created. These documents can be downloaded here: <a href="files/CJ Module Design Documents.zip" download="Cable Justice MDDs">Download MDDs</a>

				<h3 id="section2">MarioKart</h3>
				<p>
					This project stands out as my favorite among all the ones I've worked on during my school career so far. While creating a custom-built game engine, I initiated the render pipeline and subsequently crafted a MarioKart-style game utilizing the Box2D library. This engine is founded on C++ and bgfx. The game's architecture relies on a component system and, thanks to the ImGui library, it features an editor that is still a work in progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary goal of this project was to become proficient in integrating new libraries into our projects. By incorporating the Box2D library, we were able to introduce 2D physics to the game. This facilitated the implementation of various mechanics, ranging from fundamental acceleration and collision effects to the incorporation of speed pads, oil slicks, and coin pickups.

				<h3 id="section3">Small Adventure Game</h3>
				<p>
					Continuing to work with the same engine utilized for the MarioKart game mentioned earlier, I expanded its capabilities by incorporating new features, which are demonstrated in the video below. We acquired knowledge on integrating heightmaps into our engine, utilizing various shades within the image to determine different character movement heights. On the topic of characters, we also mastered the inclusion of 3D objects within the window, broadening the range of possibilities.
				</p>	
				<p>
					Following the implementation of these two features, I proceeded to introduce lighting to the engine. This served a dual purpose: enhancing the visibility of the 3D objects and introducing more visual effects to the world. Upon the initial integration of a single light source, I progressed to incorporating multiple light sources, ensuring their harmonious interaction with surfaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					The culmination of these efforts resulted in the incorporation of a significant feature into the engine: real-time terrain deformation, accompanied by dynamic adjustments to lighting and reflections.

				<h3 id="section4">Zelda</h3>
				<p>
					During the Fall of 2022, I had the opportunity to construct a 2D game engine entirely from scratch. Throughout the course, we delved into topics such as creating the initial render pipeline, establishing an event system, designing a controller, and much more. The final outcome, showcased here, represents the culmination of our efforts over the span of four months.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the components mentioned earlier, we implemented various functionalities into the engine. This encompassed the ability to parse spritesheets, construct a Tilemap, create animations, and acquire proficiency in A-Star pathfinding. In the demonstration, you can observe Link's traversal, constrained to the dirt tiles, as well as an AI entity moving among four distinct patrol points. Furthermore, users possess the capability to modify the content of the tile above them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should an obstruction block the AI's path, rendering it incapable of progressing to the subsequent point, the AI will remain stationary until a viable path is identified.

				<h3 id="section5">Bomberman Clone</h3>
				<p>This is a Bomberman clone that I developed for the Ubisoft Next competition in 2023. We had a mere three days to construct this project, utilizing their API as a foundation. I was able to leverage the skills and ideas I had acquired while crafting the above game engines, employing them to great effect. Notably, I incorporated the tile mapping and A* pathfinding techniques I had learned.

				<h3 id="section6">Breakout</h3>
				<p>
					In my first year of the Game Development program, I undertook the project of recreating a version of the classic game Breakout using the professor's custom game engine. Throughout this project, I gained insights into the mechanics of box and line collision and how to integrate them effectively. This knowledge enabled me to introduce a range of features, including fundamental ball-paddle interaction, collision with blocks and walls, and more advanced elements like power-ups that heightened the game's appeal and enjoyment. Examples of these power-ups are paddle and ball size adjustments. Additionally, the professor introduced me to the implementation of Easing and Tweening, enhancing the smoothness of these effects.

				<h3 id="section7">Asteroids</h3>
				<p>
					In my first year of the Game Development program, I was tasked with creating my own version of Asteroids using the professor's custom game engine. This marked the inaugural game I developed in my career, providing a foundational learning experience. It was during this project that I comprehended the mechanics of the basic game loop and its manipulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					This game enabled me to grasp the implementation of fundamental aspects like speed control, player maneuvering, circle-to-circle collision, and the concept of object pooling for memory management. Following the school year, I revisited the game and incorporated numerous additional features as part of my practice. These enhancements encompassed the inclusion of a main menu, the ability to restart the game without restarting the entire program, a highscore table that automatically sorts from highest to lowest, asteroid respawning, a lives system with spawn delays, and, of course, audio effects. The outcome of this project has left me genuinely content.

				<h3 id="section8">Dount Card Game</h3>
				<p>
					Although not related to programming, during my first year in the program, I was tasked with creating my own rendition of the card game Love Letter. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and wanted to showcase the version I came up with. I crafted this design entirely using Adobe Illustrator.
