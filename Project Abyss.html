					<h1>Project: Abyss</h1>
					<p>
						I am creating this blog as a weekly update to anyone that may be watching and to help myself remember what I did each week. This is for my 3rd year Capstone project the we will be completing in Unreal Engine 5.2.1. This blog will follow a casual overview of the project. I hope you enjoy!
					</p>
					<h4>Things to know</h4>
					<p>
						During this project, we are learning an Agile software development methodology called Scrum, with 1 week Sprints of at least 20 hours on top of other classes. We are using Jira as our project management tool. We are spending a school year on it that ranges from September 2023 to April 2024.

					<h2>Week 6</h2>
					<h3>Friday, October 13th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Sprint 1! The Planning Stage</h4>
					<p>
						The first sprint was a busy one. The team and I spent a lot of our time doing documentation, including the Game Design Document and various Module Design Documents. I spent most of my time on the GDD and then using this information to fill our Project Backlog that we are building in a spreadsheet. We are still getting the ropes on how to break down epics into User stories and then Tasks after that, but I have already seen an improvment over the past week, so I am confident that within the next couple weeks we will be much better at it.

					<h4>Prepping for Sprints!</h4>
					<p>
						Ok last weekend was a little bit of a break after the grind for prototype, and it gave us a chance to get caught up with other assignments as well. Towards the end of the weekend I began making spreadsheets to keep track of group dynamic issues and something called PITS points that we are using that our professor recommended. It si used to work in replacment of peer evaluations in the way that when the team contract is violated, or other violations, are commited, a PITS point is awarded and it results in lost marks later in the term. The benefit of it is that you hear about problems sooner and you are given the chance to right your wrongs as you are doing the project, not at the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, enough with that. We all had small tasks that we were to start researching and/or start planning before the beginning of the Sprints(1 Week in length). I was in charge of getting our project ready for multiplayer. This involved integrating a plugin created by a previous professor last year. This plugin allows the game to be played multiplayer over Steam, which also included a Main menu, which allows users to host or join matches, and a Lobby Map, which waits until the proper amount of users are in the game before starting the main level. I struggled a little bit, but I was able to get it functional before anybody else wanted to start working in Unreal. Most people are planning Module designs right now.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also had to find a third meeting time during each week, which turned out to be Wednesday evenings. So this makes Monday, Wednesday and Friday, which is plenty of time to cover all that we need. We are learning an Agile Software Development Methodology called Scrum, and we are using Jira as our project management tool to go along with it. All three meetings will involve stand ups for every group member. I have been elected to be the Scrum Master during our meetings, which involves leading the meetings, identifing and removing impediments and distractions, and making sure everyone is ready to go for their Sprints. Fridays are when our Sprints start and end, so that meeting is used for reviewing the previous sprint with everyone and then we assign new tasks for the next one. This is where we find out what is working and see what we need to change.
					</p>
					<p>
						The big tasks that we need to accomplish on our first Sprint is to complete the GDD and the Project Backlog, so we can plan all our future Sprints much easier, and there is one cohesive document and plan with everything laid out for us to work with. This will be a group effort at first because we are all fairly inexperienced at it, and we are still figuring out how much we need to break down into the bare bones and find and document every small mechanic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Well my job for this sprint is mainly going to be doing the above, but if I have time I am going to start planning a Module for our Divebot machine and it mechanics. I hope to have good news next Friday.

					<h3>Friday, September 29th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Pitch Presentation and Prototype</h4>
					<p>
						That was a busy week but we were able to get the Prototype done on time and ready for the presentation and you can see the video below. I will note that I only did the fish movement. Everything else was done by the other 5 programmers in the group.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "video" frameborder = "2px" src = "https://youtube.com/embed/3OBATvbLuIY" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						To create the patroling "Friendly Fish", I used a waypoint system and then lerped the movement between the points. If the fish got close enough to the player, it would flee in the other direction and then try to return to patrolling. The fish swarms are done by creating a "Swarm Leader" to act as the point they rotated around, and then I had a "Spawner" that would spawn any number of fish around this set location at a set radius, then they would hold that radius as they spun around the center point. The logic was not fine tuned as we were just getting a proof of concept out for the presentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below you will see the presentation we did as a group. I will note that this presentation was a group effort so I only had a small part in it.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Project Abyss Pitch Slideshow.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						We also had to complete a Concept Document to go along with the presentation. Here it is below if you want to take a look at it. This was also a group effort and I contributed a few pages to the document.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Concept Document.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						After all of this, we were green lit to continue! In the Friday Meeting we discussed how we were going to set up our programming structure and what each person should start researching over the weekend. Most of us are opting to take a short break before official work Sprints start next week. Monday we will be revisiting thisa nd then also go over Unreal Engine networking. Talk to you guys next week!

					<h3>Friday, September 22nd, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Game Idea Shift!</h4>
					<p>
						So this was an interesting week. We had submitted our one page documents on Monday and were ready to hear back if we had the green light to start building our prototype, then our professor messages us on Monday night and he says that our top 2 ideas are green lit, but he encouraged us to do the second game and add in the idea of the Hollow Earth Theory instead of the idea of an alien planet. He made a bunch of the group members excited about the idea and that caused us to switch directions. We are now doing the underwater exploration game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I was originally scared of the size of the project and if we were gonna be able to finish it in time, but I kept an open mind and since then the prototype has started to come together. My worries were erased and I became super excited to make the game, though this is a different kind of game than I am used to making, but that could be good and bring a different element to the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						This week, we also needed to creat a Company Identity for our group. Below you can see our document displaying the information we created. We are <b>Astral Water Interactive!</b>
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Company Identity .pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						My part to build in the prototype is to create the movement of the different fish in the scene. I will show you next week on how it turns out!

					<h3>Friday, September 15th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Pitch Creation</h4>
					<p>
						After a weekend thinking of ideas, I wa able to form a good pitch for my game with the temporary name "Robot Battle!". Original I know right? I figure we would come up with a better name later. Our meeting on Monday was over discord and this is when we all pitched our ideas. There was 5 pitches total and they were all really interesting ideas, though even at the time, I figured the Rogue-Like was the favourite. We decided to wait until Friday to make our decisions as we wanted to consider all the ideas equally. Below you can see the concept document for my pitch.
					</p>
					<!--- Insert iframe of concept doc for robot battle here --->
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Robot_Battle_Pitch.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						On Friday, we narrowed down our top 3. Number 1 being the Rogue-Like, number 2 being a underwater exploration game that combines Subnatica and Phasmophobia, and number 3 was my party game. Below you can see our 1 page documents that we needed to submit.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/One-Pagers.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						That was a good week. I will be back next Friday where we will have to start our Prototype creation.

					<h2>Week 1</h2>
					<h3>Friday, September 8th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Project Start</h4>
					<p>
						This is the first week of the project and this is when the team was formed. We are a group of 14 people! I am not used to working with this many people, though I am excited to see the ideas and the final project we can come up with! We got together and some of us knew each other, but there was a few new faces, so we went around and introduced ourselves. I hope the next week goes well. On Friday we all brought in some games that we wanted each other to try, to help get some ideas for the type of game we are going to make for our project. It seems that we started to form an idea to do a Rogue-like game that would be like the game "Risk of Rain 2" but with mechs. I also have an idea that I will form up to pitch to the group next week. I also have gained the role of Communications Contact of the group, which involves being the one to hand in all projects, making sure everyone is working together and communicating, and being a liason between the group and the professors.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is it for this week. See you next time.
