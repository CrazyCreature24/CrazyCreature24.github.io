					<h1>Project: Abyss</h1>
					<p>
						I am creating this blog as a weekly update to anyone that may be watching and to help myself remember what I did each week. This is for my 3rd year Capstone project the we will be completing in Unreal Engine 5.2.1. This blog will follow a casual overview of the project. I hope you enjoy!

					<h2>Week 4</h2>
					<h3>Friday, September 29th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Pitch Presentation and Prototype</h4>
					<p>
						That was a busy week but we were able to get the Prototype done on time and ready for the presentation and you can see the video below. I will note that I only did the fish movement. Everything else was done by the other 5 programmers in the group.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "video" frameborder = "2px" src = "https://youtube.com/embed/3OBATvbLuIY" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						To create the patroling "Friendly Fish", I used a waypoint system and then lerped the movement between the points. If the fish got close enough to the player, it would flee in the other direction and then try to return to patrolling. The fish swarms are done by creating a "Swarm Leader" to act as the point they rotated around, and then I had a "Spawner" that would spawn any number of fish around this set location at a set radius, then they would hold that radius as they spun around the center point. The logic was not fine tuned as we were just getting a proof of concept out for the presentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Below you will see the presentation we did as a group. I will note that this presentation was a group effort so I only had a small part in it.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Project Abyss Pitch Slideshow.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						We also had to complete a Concept Document to go along with the presentation. Here it is below if you want to take a look at it. This was also a group effort and I contributed a few pages to the document.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Concept Document.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						After all of this, we were green lit to continue! In the Friday Meeting we discussed how we were going to set up our programming structure and what each person should start researching over the weekend. Most of us are opting to take a short break before official work Sprints start next week. Monday we will be revisiting thisa nd then also go over Unreal Engine networking. Talk to you guys next week!

					<h2>Week 3</h2>
					<h3>Friday, September 22nd, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Game Idea Shift!</h4>
					<p>
						So this was an interesting week. We had submitted our one page documents on Monday and were ready to hear back if we had the green light to start building our prototype, then our professor messages us on Monday night and he says that our top 2 ideas are green lit, but he encouraged us to do the second game and add in the idea of the Hollow Earth Theory instead of the idea of an alien planet. He made a bunch of the group members excited about the idea and that caused us to switch directions. We are now doing the underwater exploration game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I was originally scared of the size of the project and if we were gonna be able to finish it in time, but I kept an open mind and since then the prototype has started to come together. My worries were erased and I became super excited to make the game, though this is a different kind of game than I am used to making, but that could be good and bring a different element to the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						This week, we also needed to creat a Company Identity for our group. Below you can see our document displaying the information we created. We are <b>Astral Water Interactive!</b>
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Company Identity .pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						My part to build in the prototype is to create the movement of the different fish in the scene. I will show you next week on how it turns out!

					<h2>Week 2</h2>
					<h3>Friday, September 15th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Pitch Creation</h4>
					<p>
						After a weekend thinking of ideas, I wa able to form a good pitch for my game with the temporary name "Robot Battle!". Original I know right? I figure we would come up with a better name later. Our meeting on Monday was over discord and this is when we all pitched our ideas. There was 5 pitches total and they were all really interesting ideas, though even at the time, I figured the Rogue-Like was the favourite. We decided to wait until Friday to make our decisions as we wanted to consider all the ideas equally. Below you can see the concept document for my pitch.
					</p>
					<!--- Insert iframe of concept doc for robot battle here --->
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/Robot_Battle_Pitch.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						On Friday, we narrowed down our top 3. Number 1 being the Rogue-Like, number 2 being a underwater exploration game that combines Subnatica and Phasmophobia, and number 3 was my party game. Below you can see our 1 page documents that we needed to submit.
					</p>
					<iframe class = "pdf" frameborder = "2px" src = "files/One-Pagers.pdf" allowfullscreen = "true"></iframe>
					<p>
						That was a good week. I will be back next Friday where we will have to start our Prototype creation.

					<h2>Week 1</h2>
					<h3>Friday, September 8th, 2023</h3>
					<h4>Project Start</h4>
					<p>
						This is the first week of the project and this is when the team was formed. We are a group of 14 people! I am not used to working with this many people, though I am excited to see the ideas and the final project we can come up with! We got together and some of us knew each other, but there was a few new faces, so we went around and introduced ourselves. I hope the next week goes well. On Friday we all brought in some games that we wanted each other to try, to help get some ideas for the type of game we are going to make for our project. It seems that we started to form an idea to do a Rogue-like game that would be like the game "Risk of Rain 2" but with mechs. I also have an idea that I will form up to pitch to the group next week.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is it for this week. See you next time.
