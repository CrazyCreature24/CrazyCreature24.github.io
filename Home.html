				<h3 id="aboutMe">About Me</h3>
				<p>My name is Alex McTernan. I am 26 years old and I am in my 3rd year of the Game Development program at Algonquin College in Ottawa. Through this program, I am learning about many different jobs in the industry and how 	to perform them as a generalist. This includes programming, 2D/3D artistry, level design, UI/UX, game design, and even a bit of audio and video design.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also have the option to choose a specialty, and I have chosen the programming path. This choice has led to multiple additional courses that have taught me how to create my own Game Engines using C++ and frameworks such as OpenGL and DirectX12. While I appreciate all aspects of Game Development, programming has become a true passion of mine. I relish discovering new elements to incorporate into my engine, figuring out how to implement fresh mechanics in the Unity and Unreal Engines, and exploring diverse approaches to optimize and simplify tasks.
