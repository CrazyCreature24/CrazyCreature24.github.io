				<p>My name is Alex McTernan. I am 25 years old and I have finished two of three years of the Game Development program at Algonquin College in Ottawa. 
					Through this program I am learning about a lot of the different jobs in the industry and how to do them as a generalist, this includes 
					Programming, 2D/3D Artist, Level design, UI/UX, Game Design and even a little Audio and Video design. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We also have an option to choose a specialty, and I chose programming. Through this we got an additional course that has taught me how to create my 
					own Game Engine using C++ and OpenGL. I enjoy all aspects of Game Development, but programming has become a passion of 
					mine. I enjoy finding out new things to add to my engine, or how to implent that new mechanic in Unreal Engine, and how to use 
					these things in different ways to optimize and complete tasks easier and cleaner.
